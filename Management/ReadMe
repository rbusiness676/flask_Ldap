## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Django (2.1.14)
- Django REST Framework

## Installation
```
	pip install django
	pip install djangorestframework
```

## Structure
In a RESTful API, endpoints (URLs) define the structure of the API and how end users access data from our application using the HTTP methods - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Endpoints should be logically organized around _collections_ and _elements_, both of which are resources.

In our case, we have one single resource exposed , `task`, so we will use the following URLS - `/task/` and `/task/<id>` for collections and elements, respectively.

in ""/admin/" , you can manage 'task'.

You can access each model details, using below links.

  "all task"       : "http://127.0.0.1:8000/task/"
  "task by id"     : "http://127.0.0.1:8000/task/<id>"
 "Edit task"       : "http://127.0.0.1:8000/task/<id>"    (PUT method)
 "Delete task"       : "http://127.0.0.1:8000/task/<id>"    (DELETE method)
   "Create task"       : "http://127.0.0.1:8000/task/"  (POST method) (send data json format or fill form)
